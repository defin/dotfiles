;;; Commentary:

;; The major mode for editing KM code.  Since KM is based on Lisp,
;; this mode is based on Lisp mode.  This verision of km-mode.el
;; corresponds to KM ``2.0.4''. Thanks to German Monroy for
;; refering me to Scott Andrew Borton's mode creation
;; tutorial. Please contact me with suggestions.
;;
;; Some comments for on how you can set up Emacs to use this mode
;; follow.
;;
;; You can put this file in a directory called ~/site-lisp/ and add
;; these lines to your .emacs:
;;
;; (setq global-font-lock-mode t)
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "~/site-lisp/")
;; (load "km-mode")
;;
;; Files with the .km suffix or a "-*- Mode: KM -*-" string in the
;; first line will then be loaded in KM mode. You can also switch
;; into KM mode with the command M-x km-mode.

;;; Code:

(require 'lisp-mode)

(defvar km-mode-hook nil)

;; We will parallel lisp mode. The functions in the following list
;; won't quite work, but maybe we can write some code that does
;; something similar.  Some of the functions from the lisp mode
;; keymap will work, and those are bound just below.
